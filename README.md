# Radar-Intra-Pulse-Modulation-Simulation


In this repository, we simulate various intra-pulse modulation patterns using Python, including frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM). For FM signals, we include linear frequency modulation (LFM) and sine frequency modulation (SFM). For PM signals, we incorporate 64-bit polyphase code signals, including Frank code and codes P1, P2, P3, and P4.
